## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go to issues and create a new one, once i see it i will add it to my to do list.<br>
If vulnerability is proven to be correct you can expect it fixed in next release, but if you are impatiens you can download prerelease which i don't recommend because there are a lot of bugs
